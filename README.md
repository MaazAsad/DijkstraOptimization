# DijkstraOptimization
Algorithms Project, Batch 18.

## Abstract
The Algorithm we were to implement was "An Improved Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm" by Yizhen Huang, Qingming Yi, and Min Shi of College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. As the name suggests, it is an improvement over the basic data structure based Dijkstra algorithm, by using a search strategy based technique. In this technique, based on the angle between the vector of current path and desired path, the algorithm rules out unnecessary paths.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.7+
- Numpy
- Pytest and GitHub Actions for CI Testing
